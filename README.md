# DeepGenMSM

Here, we collect the code necessary to reproduce the results of our Project "Deep generative Markov State models for dynamical systems".

The folder Prinz contains the code for the 1D four well Prinz potential using PyTorch.

The folder AlaDi contains the code for the Alanine Dipeptide molecule and the generation of new structures using Tensorflow.
